# Analyzing-CAPM
One of my assignments in school. My group and I explored whether the CAPM pricing model held up in the real world and tested it using a time-series regression and a cross-sectional regression, where we regressed asset returns against market returns to check for the existence of an alpha coefficient. We also explored the performance of different Fama-French factors.
